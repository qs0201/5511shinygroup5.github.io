	<h1>The Poisson Distribution</h1>
	<p>The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of an event happening for a given number of times within a certain interval of time or space under the following assumptions:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>At most one occurrence at an instant</li>
		<li>The occurrence of the events are independent of each other</li>
		<li>The average number of occurrence is proportional to the size of the interval</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The Poisson distribution is characterized by a single parameter, denoted by Î» (lambda), which is the mean or average number of occurrence of the in a fixed interval. The Poisson probability mass function for an event occurring k times is as follows:</p>

	<p>where e is the mathematical constant e (approximately 2.71828), and k! denotes the factorial of k (i.e., the product of all positive integers up to k).</p>
